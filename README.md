Information for contributors

To talk about the organization I created a gitter room [firsttimersonly](https://gitter.im/firsttimersonly/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link)

If you want to help out. Pick a project you're passionate about/want to learn, and then run the test suite.
Find a test that you can make fail by changing the code, we want to make sure its pretty easily solvable.
Then upload your changes and create an issue with the some information on the bug. As soon as someone comments on taking
the issue, assign it to that person and help them out until the code is able to be merged.

Then rinse/repeat with different bugs/projects.
